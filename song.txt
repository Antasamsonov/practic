Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for the place to go
Where they play the right music,
Getting in the swing

You come in to look for a King
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music’s high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You’re in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance…
